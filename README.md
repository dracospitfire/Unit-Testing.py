# Unit-Testing.py
Simple test case for testing python code

Created a function in the test_myModule class for each function we want to test. Named the functions by prepending test to the function we want to test.

Note: **only functions that start with test are run.**

Finally, start creating test cases. This is done by using the assertEqual function. Assert Equal compares two values and determines if they are equal. This is used to check if functions are returning the correct values.
